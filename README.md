### **Hi, I’m Twinkletrees!** 🌿

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a mature data science student at **Northumbria University**, and I love combining my tech skills with a bit of whimsy. Whether it's tracking magical creatures or building a potion shop database, I like to put a fun twist on my projects while learning the ropes of data science.

### **🔮 What I’m Working On:**
- **herbs_and_hexes**: A public SQL project where I manage ingredients and potion recipes for a fantasy potion shop. It’s my way of practicing complex SQL queries, triggers, and stored procedures, but with a bit of magic thrown in!
- **scrying-sentiments**: This private project uses NLP to analyze the emotional arcs of stories, like peering into a crystal ball to unearth hidden emotions. 
- **cryptid-cluster**: A private project where I’m classifying supernatural creatures—think of it as monster detection meets machine learning.
- **creature-watchtower**: A private project where I keep an eye on mystical population shifts (dragons, unicorns, you name it). It’s all about building a cloud-based data pipeline.
- **enchanters-almanac**: This is my personal automation project. I’m using APIs and time series analysis to automate weather-based decisions—because even laundry should have a touch of magic.

### **🛠️ What I Can Do, kind of, almost, getting there:**
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Database Management**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, NLP with TextBlob
- **Cloud & Automation**: AWS, Google Cloud, API Integration
- **Azure Qualifications**: DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals) and AI-900 (Azure AI Fundamentals)

### **📚 What I’m Learning**:
I’m still wrapping my head around the basics, but I’m aiming to get deeper into:
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Especially clustering and regression.
- **Time Series Analysis**: So I can make more predictions (with or without magic).
- **Cloud Computing**: Because deploying data science applications is a whole new world.

### **Fun Facts About Me**:
- When I’m not coding, I’m diving into **all things crafty**. Lately, I’ve been **knitting** up a storm! 🧶
- I’m a big fan of combining fantasy with data science to make learning fun.
- My favorite project so far has been **herbs_and_hexes**, where SQL meets a potion shop!
